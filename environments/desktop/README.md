# Environment / Desktop

This environment is designed for Dekstop Environment agnostic programs.

Basically, sets of programs that are not dependant on a specific desktop environment or window manager, but commonly used and requires any DE or WM to run properly.

Note that this environment is very barebones and does not include any desktop environment or window manager. See other environment like KDE or Hyprland for those.

The `system` module is very likely already imported by graphical environments, but `home-manager` module is very likely to be not,
because they are not essential for a desktop environment to run as it should be.
